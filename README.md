# MadLib
This is console based mad lib app that takes user input and outputs [hopefully] funny song lyrics. There are excerpts of three songs built in. User input is checked by a regex to ensure input is at least 2 alpha characters, then stored in an array, and lastly inserted into the song via concatenation and indexing. Once finished, you’ll have the option to see the original song lyrics. A master loop lets you try another mad lib or exit. A log will create an external .txt file to track errors and invalid inputs.

To execute the program, clone the repo to your machine. Using the terminal/shell of your choice, navigate to the project directory and executte the command "dotnet run". You will then be prompted to make a selection and complete a mad lib or exit.
