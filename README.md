# MadLib -- DOUBLE CHECK WHAT YOU'VE MET BEFORE SUBMITTING
This is console based mad lib app that takes user input and outputs [hopefully] funny song lyrics. There are excerpts of three songs built in. User input is stored in an array, then inserted into the song via concatenation and indexing. Once finished, you’ll have the option to see the original song lyrics. A master loop lets you try another mad lib or exit. A log will create an external .txt file to track errors and invalid inputs.
